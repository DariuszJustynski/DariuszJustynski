- Coding Principles

1. Never skip commits. Never.
Every change matters. History is part of the system.

2. Input is always malware. Always.
Trust nothing. Validate everything.

3. Among users, be the developer. Be.
Understand the system from the inside, not from the interface.

4. Ideas are forever.
Code decays. Concepts compound.

5. People come and go. Let it flow.
Systems must survive personnel changes.

6. Diamond hands.
Long-term thinking beats short-term optimization.

7. Granite core.
Deterministic, heuristic, low-level, resilient by design.

8. Publish theory. Sell practice.
Share intent. Protect implementation.
